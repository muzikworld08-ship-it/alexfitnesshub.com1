    subtitle: "Reverse rounded shoulders, forward neck slumps, and rigid spinal alignments.",
    icon: <Activity className="w-6 h-6" />,
    themeColor: "from-blue-500 to-indigo-600",
    explanation: "Desk Body Syndrome is a musculoskeletal imbalance caused by prolonged typing, mouse usage, and staring at screens. It is characterized by overactive chest muscles, underactive upper back muscles, and a protruding chin that strains the neck.",
    whyToday: "Modern screens hold our gaze downwards. Over-reliance on laptops and chairs molds our spinal column into an unnatural C-shape instead of a healthy S-curve.",
    risks: [
      "Chronic neck pain and tension headaches",
      "Reduced lung capacity due to a compressed ribcage",
      "Anterior Pelvic Tilt and lower back compensation"
    ],
    benefits: [
      "Confident, upright posture and expanded chest capacity",
      "Immediate reduction in tension headaches and neck fatigue",
      "Enhanced physical presence and mechanical lifting leverage"
    ],
    scienceNote: "Biomechanical studies show every inch of forward head tilt adds an extra 10 lbs of pressure on the cervical spine.",
    habits: {

    subtitle: "Combat modern high-dopamine screen time weight gain and metabolic stagnation.",
    icon: <Apple className="w-6 h-6" />,
    themeColor: "from-emerald-500 to-teal-600",
    explanation: "Digital Obesity describes the metabolic down-regulation resulting from screen-bound sedentary patterns. Continuous visual overstimulation from feeds triggers passive snacking while keeping your muscle tissue locked in low-consumption states.",
    whyToday: "Instant meal deliveries, automated transit, and algorithm-optimized apps reward complete immobility while feeding us highly palatable, calorie-dense foods.",
    risks: [
      "Insulin resistance and rapid visceral fat accumulation",
      "Depleted baseline energy reserves and brain fog",
      "Elevated systemic inflammation and low HRV scores"
    ],
    benefits: [
      "Pristine blood glucose control and enhanced fat oxidation",
      "Constant steady-state physical energy throughout the day",
      "Improved sleep depth and mental resilience"

    icon: <Dumbbell className="w-6 h-6" />,
    themeColor: "from-red-500 to-orange-600",
    explanation: "Our bodies operate on a strict 'use it or lose it' muscle preservation code. Without deliberate heavy loading, modern lifestyle prompts our metabolism to shed energy-expensive skeletal muscle fiber, replacing it with passive adipose tissue.",
    whyToday: "Our daily lives require zero physical resistance. We lift no heavy loads, pull no resistance items, and carry no water, resulting in structural muscle wastage.",
    risks: [
      "Slower metabolic rate making weight gain highly effortless",
      "Joint instability, especially inside vulnerable knees and shoulder capsules",
      "Early frailty and compromised physical independence"

    subtitle: "Overcome physiological vascular shutdown from sitting >6 hours daily.",
    icon: <Move className="w-6 h-6" />,
    themeColor: "from-amber-500 to-yellow-600",
    explanation: "Sitting Disease is the scientific term used to describe systemic metabolic shutdown. When sitting, electrical activity in the legs drops to zero, calorie burning drops to 1 per minute, and arterial blood flow drops substantially.",
    whyToday: "From office chairs to car commutes and couches, we spend an average of 9.3 hours per day seated, bypassing our body's built-in muscle pumps.",
    risks: [
      "Inhibited lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity causing poor blood lipid clearance",
      "Vascular stiffness and lower-limb fluid pooling",

    title: "Stress Burnout Syndrome",
    isFree: false,
    subtitle: "Reset hyper-sympathetic cortisol spikes and recover deep nervous energy.",
    icon: <Brain className="w-6 h-6" />,
    themeColor: "from-purple-500 to-pink-600",
    explanation: "Stress Burnout occurs when your sympathetic nervous system is perpetually activated without receiving a physiological safety signal. Chronic work deadlines, notification alerts, and lack of motion pool cortisol in the body.",
    whyToday: "Unchecked digital inputs never allow the nervous system to enter parasympathetic rest. We are always on, always reacting, and rarely resting.",
    risks: [
      "Chronic systemic inflammation and suppressed immune response",
      "Sleep disruption and fragmented REM patterns",
      "Adrenal fatigue, constant anxiety, and physical exhaustion"

    subtitle: "Supercharge dormant mitochondria and restore standard metabolic vigor.",
    icon: <Flame className="w-6 h-6" />,
    themeColor: "from-orange-500 to-red-600",
    explanation: "A Low Energy Lifestyle is characterized by mitochondrial stagnation. When we minimize physical demands, our cells optimize by reducing their energy output, leading to persistent daily fatigue.",
    whyToday: "We consume artificial light, process sugars, and limit motion, forcing our cellular energy centers to down-regulate their natural ATP output.",
    risks: [
      "Persistent brain fog and cognitive resistance to focus",
      "Reduced cardiac stroke volume and low cardiorespiratory baseline",
      "Increased dependence on chemical stimulants"
    ],
    benefits: [
      "Natural morning alertness without immediate caffeine dependency",
      "Superb physical stamina to breeze through long active days",

    title: "Core Weakness Crisis",
    isFree: false,
    subtitle: "Secure your abdominal shield and eliminate heavy lumbar load transfers.",
    icon: <Shield className="w-6 h-6" />,
    themeColor: "from-cyan-500 to-blue-600",
    explanation: "A weak core is the single greatest cause of adult back pain. Sitting deactivates your abdominal wall and glutes, leaving your lower spine to bear the entire mechanical weight of your torso during daily movements.",
    whyToday: "Modern seating relieves our abdominal stabilizer muscles of their natural posture duties, causing them to atrophy.",
    risks: [
      "Lumbar disc herniation and acute lower back muscle spasms",
      "Poor transfer of force during compound exercises",
      "Compromised balance, hip misalignment, and knee wear"
    ],
    benefits: [
      "An ironclad abdominal corset that supports and protects your spine",
      "Enhanced physical power in squats, deadlifts, and daily carrying",
      "Pain-free standing, running, and physical agility"
    ],
    scienceNote: "The core is not just your abs; it is a 3D box of muscles including the transverse abdominis, obliques, and pelvic floor stabilizers.",
    habits: {
      hydrationOz: 90,
      nutritionTip: "Supplement with minerals like magnesium to prevent deep muscle cramps and optimize core firing patterns.",

    title: "Metabolic Slowdown",
    isFree: false,
    subtitle: "Ignite sluggish cellular fires and elevate baseline fat oxidation.",
    icon: <Droplets className="w-6 h-6" />,
    themeColor: "from-teal-500 to-blue-600",
    explanation: "Metabolic Slowdown happens when a sedentary lifestyle and poor lean muscle mass signal your body to conserve energy, locking you in a continuous fat-storing mode.",
    whyToday: "Processed high-glycemic foods coupled with zero movement slow down our active thyroid hormone output, lowering baseline body temperature.",
    risks: [
      "Extremely rapid fat gain even from modest portion sizes",
      "Persistent cold sensitivity and sluggish physical reflexes",
      "Declining vascular health and lipid profiles"
    ],
    benefits: [
      "Rapid nutrient partitioning—food is stored as muscle fuel, not fat",
      "High natural thermogenic temperature and quick physical recovery",
      "Effortless maintenance of lean, healthy body fat percentages"
    ],
    scienceNote: "Building just 5 lbs of lean muscle increases your resting metabolic rate by 50 to 150 calories daily, indefinitely.",
    habits: {
      hydrationOz: 120,
      nutritionTip: "Incorporate metabolism-boosting ginger, garlic, and green tea into your nutritional profile.",

    subtitle: "Break up fibrotic tissue restrictions and restore youthful joint elasticity.",
    icon: <Sparkles className="w-6 h-6" />,
    themeColor: "from-violet-500 to-fuchsia-600",
    explanation: "Mobility Decline is the gradual stiffening of muscle fascia and joint capsules due to limited movement ranges. This restriction shortens muscle tissue, making common movements rigid and injury-prone.",
    whyToday: "Seated living rarely challenges our joints to move through full athletic paths, causing our soft tissues to adaptively shorten.",
    risks: [
      "Shortened ligaments resulting in joint compression and early arthritis",
      "Loss of ability to perform deep, natural squat depths or high reaches",
      "High risk of muscle tears during minor athletic activities"

    subtitle: "Protect cognitive pathways, retain critical bone density, and live fully.",
    icon: <Award className="w-6 h-6" />,
    themeColor: "from-rose-500 to-red-600",
    explanation: "Aging doesn't require physical decline. The 'Healthy Aging Challenge' integrates modern resistance mechanics, posture correction, and balance training to maintain physical autonomy and vitality for decades.",
    whyToday: "Modern comfort encourages older adults to withdraw from physically challenging tasks, accelerating bone density loss and motor nerve decay.",
    risks: [
      "Fragile bones (osteoporosis) prone to major fractures from simple trips",
      "Neuromuscular decline leading to loss of physical balance",
      "Loss of independent movement and cognitive decline"
    ],
    benefits: [
      "Dense, strong bone structures and robust neuromuscular balance",
      "Sharp cognitive reflexes and high natural dopamine levels",
      "Complete physical independence and active movement confidence"
    ],
